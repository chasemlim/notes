Today: 
- [] Can I win - leetcode  4/6
- [] Given two dom elements, tell if everything beneath them is identical.  5/6
- [] BST problem - leetcode  5/6
- [] Explain and code Throttle and Debounce, then add functionality to throttle where it records all clicks and fires them all at intervals 6/6 
- [] Write a webpage with 3 links, when you click each one, write a fetch for that link and then under the link print the wait time 5/6

Tomorrow:
